## Testing instructions

- Go to the application tab in devtools. 
- Add in a new storage key/value pair using local storage where...
- Key is testHour (get the camel casing right)
       and...
  Value is <some integer from 0 - 23...represents hours of the day>.
- Setting testHour will allow you to test the background color assignmets (past=grey, present=red, future=green) for whatever daily hour you choose.
- NOTE: The Work Day Scheduler website provided has been set up with the "testHour" and "events" local storage in place for 2PM...to mimic the image provided.  Remove the Keys in local storage to test actual time conditions.
