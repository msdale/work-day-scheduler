## Testing instructions

- Go to the application tab in devtools. 
- Add in a new storage key/value pair using Session storage where...
- Key is testHour (get the camel casing right)
       and...
  Value is <some integer from 0 - 23...represents hours of the day>.
- Setting testHour will allow you to test the background color assignmets (past=grey, present=red, future=green) for whatever daily hour you choose.
- NOTE: A value less than 9 for testHour will show up on the Work Day Scheduler as all green events (future).
      And a value more than 17 will show up on the Work Day Scheduler as all grey events (past).
